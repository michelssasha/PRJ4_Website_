      <h2>Marketing</h2>
<h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
		<p>Our social media campaign <span>#UPspiration</span> consists of weekly inspirational posts with a self-explanatory purpose – to motivate and serve as a source for empowerment to our target audience. To break it down in more detail, every week throughout the duration of PRJ4 we posted a motivational quote from celebrities from various walks of life with the aim of our audience starting their week freshly with a positive mindset. Furthermore, we posted each week an inspirational short story on our Facebook page. There we asked our audience to guess the moral of the stories. We purposefully avoided direct sharing of the moral as we intended to provoke the consumer, to persuade them subconsciously to spend a little bit more time interacting on our content while contributing to their own empowerment as well. Two days later, we always posted a quote on Instagram, taken from the weekly inspirational story. We did that for multiple purposes. First of all, we aimed at promoting one social media account to the other one, resulting in a shared audience and greater reach. Besides that, we encouraged people in a subtle way to think abstractly and show them that a moral could be whatever works for them. We aimed at showing that empowerment is left up to everyone’s own interpretation. We believe that the short quotes from the stories were best at serving that purpose as they were usually written in a fictional and intriguing manner.</p>
      <h5>Our message</h5>
  <p class="italic">"Get inspired, empower yourself and others, and achieve your goals."</p>
  <p>Throughout the project span we made sure to always aim directly at spreading across our message.</p>

					  <li><span>Sales Promotion:</span> post of the Hologram Sneaker – limited edition</li>

            <p><span>Instagram:</span></p>     
  <p class="justification">The reason why we chose Instagram as our main social media platform is because a significant part of its user base corresponds with our target audience. Furthermore, Instagram is offering various ways of content sharing such as stories, posts, reels (short videos), shopping options, advertising.</p>  
			
			<p><span>Facebook:</span></p>     
			<p class="justification">We opted for Facebook as it is directly connected to Instagram. The posts and stories sharing between both platforms is very easy, which makes it fast to interact and reach our audience. Another reason for choosing Facebook is because our target audience consists of people unlimited by culture and origin. This would suggest that people are located worldwide, and the most preferred social media varies per country. In order to maximize the reach, we chose based on research the most used social media platforms by young adults.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
  	<div class="biography-contents col-9 col-sm-10 col-md-9 col-lg-10">
                  
                  <!-- Use the list below to talk about your achievements -->
    <ul>
					  <li class="space"> Throughout the duration of the project and execution of our campaign <span>#UPspiration</span>, we learned that  Facebook is way harder to develop than we initially thought. The reason behind this is because the invitations we sent to people to like and follow our page are mostly being disregarded as people tend to see these kinds of notifications as spam messages. What we would have done differently if we had the chance to start over is to find various ways of promoting our Facebook page as the one with sending out direct invitations was not as successful initially expected.</li>
					  
					  <li class="space"> When posting our weekly inspirational stories, we have always put our question to the audience at the end of the story itself. As Facebook does not offer the option to alter font size and style, we could not make the question more distinguishable than the story itself, which caused people simply not to notice there was even a question to answer. What we would change is to put our question regarding the moral of the story in an image under the text of the story, as images tend to catch attention more frequently.</li>
					  
					  <li class="space"> Although after thorough research we concluded that Facebook is the second-best suitable platform for <span>UPSPIRE</span>, in practice it turned out that our audience there was very passive. For the future we would consider a different social media platform as a second one – such as TikTok for instance or at least adding it to our social media choices as Facebook is not as responsive as we initially expected. </li>
					  
					  <li class="space">Since we are based in the Netherlands, the Facebook algorithm prioritizes the posts to people located near our surroundings. In this country our target audience uses Facebook relatively less than in other countries. We should have conducted  more research into social media usage in different countries.</li>
					  
    </ul>
  </div>	
     
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <div class="biography-contents col-9 col-sm-10 col-md-9 col-lg-10">
                  
                  <!-- Use the list below to talk about your achievements -->
    <ul>
					  <li class="space"> If the project would have continued for another 8 weeks (about 2 months), we would have definitely started with thorough planning and scheduling for social media as well as for mandatory group meetings.</li>
					  
					  <li class="space"> We would create paid advertisements not only as posts but also as stories, this decision is based on personal experience and opinions of people that we interviewed. Advertisements on stories are a very subtle way to introduce yourself to the audience, because usually if the advertisement is thought out very well, it is hard to tell that it is even an advertisement, which causes people to spend more time on exploring it's content. </li>
					  
					  <li class="space"> We would increase the number of reels that, and videos in general, that we post, because reels are something that attracts the audience very easily once they get onto the trending page. Judging by the analytics that we have had so far, reels were the greatest contribution to the quick growth of our Instagram account.  </li>
		      		  
		              <li class="space">Besides that, we would also aim at spreading awareness about the hashtags that we created ourselves such as '#uspire' and '#upspire&you'. This would increase the tendency of people using our hashtag once they purchased our sneakers or shared an inspirational post from our page.   </li>
					  
					  <li class="space">We would post reviews from satisfied customers as this would increase the trustworthiness of our potential customers and social media consumers.</li>
		
					  <li class="space">We would think of a feasible way to continue executing our current campaign '#storytime' in real life since we believe that direct communication between creator and consumer is the key for a successful brand development.  </li>
